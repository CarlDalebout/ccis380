\begin{myenumt}
\li Prove statements about vectors
\end{myenumt}

I expect the proofs to be properly written in the mathematical sense.
Every step must be justified.
Once you have finish one proof, talk to me.
I'll make suggestions and point out the mistakes,
you make the corrections, and repeat until it's really done.
It's best to print out a hardcopy (free printing at BUH CS Lab)
so I can make comments/corrections on it.
Talk to one another too.

If you need a fact to justify a deduction, but you can't prove it
or find it in the axioms, let me know.
If it's too difficult to prove, I'll give hints.
If it's still too difficult, I might include that as a fact without proof
for you to use.

There is a \verb!latex.pdf! at my website \url{http://yliow.github.io}.
Or just ask me if you have questions about \LaTeX.
